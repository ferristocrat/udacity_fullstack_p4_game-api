#Hangman API
Udacity Full Stack Web Development - Project 4: Design a Game API


##Synopsis

This is my fourth of a series of projects through Udacity's **Full Stack Web Development** course, through which I have been learning web development. This is an application using Google App Engine.


## Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
1.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.

From the Command Line:

**DEV Environment**
```
python "path\to\dev_appserver.py" directory_where_application_sits/
```
Example:
```
python "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\google_appengine\dev_appserver.py" udacity_fullstack_p4_game-api/
```
**Upload to production environment**
```
python "path\to\appcfg.py" -A project-name -V v1 update directory_where_application_sits/
```
Example:
```
python "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\google_appengine\appcfg.py" -A ferristocrat-hangman -V v1 
update udacity_fullstack_p4_game-api/
```
 
##Game Description:
This is a simple hangman game.  Each game begins with the user entering a word 
length between 10 and 20 (10 by default if no length is entered).  A word is then
fetched using a GET request to a [Random Word API](http://randomword.setgetgo.com/). The user then guesses
letters one-by-one and is only able to get 6 wrong before losing.  API methods are
described in more detail below.


##Files Included:
 - api.py: Contains endpoints and game playing logic.
 - app.yaml: App configuration.
 - cron.yaml: Cronjob configuration.
 - main.py: Handler for taskqueue handler.
 - models.py: Entity and message definitions including helper methods.
 - utils.py: Helper function for retrieving ndb.Models by urlsafe Key string.

##Endpoints Included:
 - **create_user**
    - Path: 'user'
    - Method: POST
    - Parameters: user_name, email (optional)
    - Returns: Message confirming creation of the User.
    - Description: Creates a new User. user_name provided must be unique. Will 
    raise a ConflictException if a User with that user_name already exists.
    
 - **new_game**
    - Path: 'game'
    - Method: POST
    - Parameters: user_name, min, max, attempts
    - Returns: GameForm with initial game state.
    - Description: Creates a new Game. user_name provided must correspond to an
    existing user - will raise a NotFoundException if not. Min must be less than
    max. Also adds a task to a task queue to update the average moves remaining
    for active games.
     
 - **get_game**
    - Path: 'game/{urlsafe_game_key}'
    - Method: GET
    - Parameters: urlsafe_game_key
    - Returns: GameForm with current game state.
    - Description: Returns the current state of a game.
    
 - **make_move**

    - Method: PUT
    - Parameters: urlsafe_game_key, guess
    - Returns: GameForm with new game state.
    - Description: Accepts a 'guess' and returns the updated state of the game.
    If this causes a game to end, a corresponding Score entity will be created.

    - Returns: ScoreForms.
    - Description: Returns all Scores in the database (unordered).
